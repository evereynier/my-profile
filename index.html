				  	<h2>Cooking</h2>
				  	<p>Cooking is one of my favorite passions, where I blend various ingredients and spices to craft delicious meals that create various delicious taste. From mastering the art of baking pastries to perfecting the balance of flavors in a curry, I find endless inspiration in the culinary world. The kitchen a place where I can experiment new recipes and share the joy of food with friends and family.

				  	<h2>Photography</h2>
				  	<p>I love photography because it allows me to keep memories of moments of life with my family and friends or just my general daily life in school or during trips. In fact, I like that months later I can look back at my photos and remember the good times I had. Moreover, through a camera we see the world around us differently and I find that fascinating.

				  	<h2>Travel</h2>
				  	<p>I also love traveling around the world. This allows me to meet new cultures and new people with different traditions and I find it very enriching on a human level. In addition, seeing landscapes that are always different and each more surprising than the other allows me to get out of routine and open myself up to other things than our French landscapes.

				  	<h2>Music</h2>
				  	<p>My other passion is music because it is something that accompanies me on a daily moment, whether itâ€™s at home or on my way to school for example. I appreciate the fact that it is accessible to everyone and that everyone inevitably finds the musical style that suits them. This even allows you to create links with others and offer beautiful moments of cohesion.
